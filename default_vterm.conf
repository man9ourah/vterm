# The default configuration file for VTerm.
# VTerm will look for a configuration file in the following order:
#   1- The configuration file passed as an argument.
#   2- Then, the user config file, usually ~/.config/vterm/vterm.conf 
#   3- Then, one of the directories in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS if defined + /vterm/vterm.conf
#   4- If all fail, it will use hardcoded defaults options, displayed below for clarity.
# The file name MUST be vterm.conf in a directory named vterm

# The configuration file is split into two sections:
# 1) A behavior section, and 2) A style section.
# It is important to mark the beginning of sections, and only place options in
